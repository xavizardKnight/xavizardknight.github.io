    <h1>I've moved this website to Gitlab</h1>
    <br>
    <p>You are going to be redirected to GitLab, where the new webiste is.</p>
    <p>I had a placeholder website in GitHub and I wanted to expand it more.
    <br>Recently, I decided to move from GitHub to GitLab and complete this website in GitLab.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If the redirection doesn't work (or you are still reading this text lol), click <a href="https://xavizardknight.gitlab.io/">here</a> to get redirected.
    <br>
    <p>You can also click this complete URL: <a href="https://xavizardknight.gitlab.io/">https://xavizardknight.gitlab.io/</a>
